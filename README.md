#Objective of the Project
<br>
The objective of this project is to analyze logistics data, identify inefficiencies in a supply chain, and optimize resource allocation. Specifically, it aims to:

1. Data Analysis:

Examine transportation costs, delivery times, and resource usage across various locations.

Calculate averages to establish benchmarks and identify deviations.



2. Inefficiency Identification:

Detect locations where costs, delivery times, or resource usage exceed the average, highlighting potential inefficiencies.



3. Optimization:

Suggest optimized resource allocations to minimize inefficiencies while ensuring operational efficiency.



4. Visualization:

Provide visual insights using bar charts and scatter plots to make the findings more intuitive and actionable.




Use Cases

This project can help businesses:

Reduce logistics costs by identifying costly inefficiencies.

Improve delivery times through better planning and resource distribution.

Enhance overall operational efficiency using data-driven decision-making.


By combining analytical outputs and visual insights, this project enables stakeholders to quickly understand supply chain performance and implement effective optimizations.
